This is a very minimal terminal emulator I built to help me understand a bit
more about processes and how they are handled in linux. It is written purely
in C and contains only a fraction of the available options that normal 
terminals have:

  * echo (no options available and can only be used to print, no command
  processing with $() operator)

  * ls (r, a, A and l options available)

  * clear (clears the screen)

  * exit (kills the process)


I have also worked a little on shell operators and their functionality, 
however precedence is sometimes wrong when dealing with abstract order
of operations (meaning longer operator chaining): "&&", "||", "|", ";"

IMPORTANT: DO NOT USE TABS
